# Remittance Patterns and Economic Development
**Introduction**  
Over the years, a remarkable increase in remittance inflows especially to developing countries has been reported with a current estimate of $860 billion for 2023 globally (World Bank-KNOMAD, 2023). This money from migrant workers represents a certain percentage of a nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is usually channelled towards feeding, education, healthcare, business, etc. It is thus expected that the positive implication of remittance inflow will outweigh any negative outcome in the recipient developing economy.  
Therefore, this research seeks to explicitly define the role of remittance in propelling economic development as evidenced by data analysis and artificial intelligence through machine learning.  
Most key measures of economic development are yet to be assessed in relation with remittance patterns. These indicators include Human Development Index (HDI), Inflation, Consumption per capita, Human Poverty Index (HPI), and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) which takes into account health, education, and standard of living. Through these indicated perspectives, the intending research will explore the associated theme.  

**Problem Statement**  
Remittance contributes a notable percentage to the GDP of developing countries, however, for these recipients, translated economic impacts remain poorly measured. Hence, due to this knowledge gap, a globally acceptable framework that integrates remittance and economic development is currently lacking. The absence of such inhibits consistent tandem monitoring and projections which are both crucial to proactively uphold policies for consistent increase in remittance inflow to developing economies.  

**Objectives**  
This research aims at elucidating the economic implications of remittance for top recipient countries by;  
•	Assessing the remittance recipient trends featuring the top 10 countries based on  2023 estimated report  
•	Evaluating the effect of remittance on economic development through key indicators such as GDP, HDI, HPI, MPI, etc.  
•	Leveraging artificial intelligence through machine learning to train models for corresponding prediction, as well as, improving the accuracy  
•	Deploying trained model  

**Methodology**  
**Datasets**  
•	Remittance Data from Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (World Bank - KONMAD, 2023  
•	Economic Outlook Data from International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook Database, 2024  
•	Human Development reports from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2024  
•	Any additional dataset will be subsequently outlined in the final documentation  


**Data Analysis and Modeling**  
•	Data cleaning and preprocessing to appropriately manage missing values and encode data as deemed necessar  
•	Exploratory data analysis  
•	Statistical correlation between variables  
•	Training Models and evaluation of performance  

**Model Deployment**  
The Machine learning model with the best performance will be deployed on Streamlit framework for user-friendly real-time forecast.
